Our app has a bunch of bugs in it! With your group debug the app and get it working again.   

Let the errors happen one at a time.   

Before fixing anything, read/discover the error and discuss it with your group. What might be obvious to you may not be obvious to someone else so make you discuss as a group how you got to a specific conclusion. 

The purpose of this is not to debug the application as quickly as possible, but to practice good debugging conventions. Even if you think you know the fix for a specific bug, take a moment to review the steps of the debugging process. 

Debugging process
- Consider the goal of the code.
- What is the expected behavior?
- What are all the components that make up this behavior?
- What does the error/stack trace say?
- What can we assume about the error?
- Think about how to debug each assumption.
- Debug and repeat until the assumption is true.
